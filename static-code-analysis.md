Static code analysis is a general term for many different techniques. There are
analyses of program syntax, semantics, control and data flow. These analyses can
help you pinpoint problems that aren't easy to do with manual testing because
they are able to *generate* scenarios than you could do by hand. They can also
be used to identify portions of code that are potential bottlenecks or error
prone. Overflow, underflow, rounding errors, and array bounds checking are all
items that you may not face in tests, but become immediately evident when real
usage begins.
