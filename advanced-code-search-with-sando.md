> [Sando](http://sando.codeplex.com/)  is an indexed search tool, which
> means two things: it's fast and it's accurate. Indexed search is more
> accurate than the ordinary code search functionality built into the
> IDE, which outright fails most of the time anyway [^Ko-etal]!
> [Sando](http://sando.codeplex.com/) also comes with auto-suggestions
> to help you quickly find what you need. **It's basically Google for
> your project.**
> 
> Bottom line: if your project is bigger than one to two hundred lines
> of code (it is), you should be using
> [Sando](http://sando.codeplex.com/).
