Refactoring is something you are doing all of the time whether you realize it or
not. It is an essential part of coding, and helps to reduce defects (Kim et
al.). Sometimes, you may find yourself saying "this method would make much more
sense if it was named..." and now you're plodding around changing every usage of
that method to the new name. What a waste of time; you might as well have left
the name nonsensical!

Refactoring tools help you accomplish this by automatically changing the usages
for you. Plus, refactoring tools help you avoid mistakes in refactoring. Pretty
soon, computers will be programming themselves!
