Searching through code isn't easy, especially when you've got several hundred
modules with a million LOC. Use some of the standard code search features to
help you quickly navigate around the code base with ease. Plus, it beats
scrolling around files aimlessly looking for where a feature is implemented.

Here are a few examples:

Find All References (`Shift`+`F12`):
:   A context menu option when you right-click on a symbol in the editor

Find (`Ctrl`+`F`)
:   Find in current file or larger scope
