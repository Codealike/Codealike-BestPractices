Prodet is a productivity tool suite that focuses on three common pain points. It
helps you:
 
1. quickly navigate code, 
2. accurately locate a starting point,
3. and visualize their working set without a cognitive burden.

Prodet has shown to help developers navigate structurally (Augustine et al.),
which saves on time to complete a task (Fritz et al.). The "Code Navigation
Window" automatically generates a map that matches your mental model of how code
flows around the method call graph, highlighting the most important and relevant
information to whatever you're working on.
