ReSharper adds over 40 different refactoring methods with a few hundred context
actions and is a widely used tool. It goes above and beyond the built-in
refactoring commands by replacing most of your typical refactoring headaches
with safe and automatic commands so you can confidently do that major
refactoring you've been putting off since the first release.
